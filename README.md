## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app - `port: 3000 `
- `web`: another [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app - `port: 3001`
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn run dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching (Beta)](https://turborepo.org/docs/features/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching (Beta) you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
